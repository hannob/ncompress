# ncompress

## About

Compress is a fast, simple [LZW] file compressor.
Compress does not have the highest compression rate, but it is one of the
fastest programs to compress data.
Compress is the defacto standard in the UNIX community for compressing files.

The ncompress code is released into the [public domain].

Also note that all existing patents on the LZW algorithm have
[expired world-wide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZW#Patent_issues).

## Status

The last "upstream" release will be supported in minor bug fix mode only.
These will be the 4.2.4.x releases.

Anything above and beyond that will be the 4.2.5.x releases.

All releases will continue to be [public domain].
